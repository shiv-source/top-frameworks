## 📊 Score Calculation

The popularity score of each technology (programming language, framework, database, testing tool, or DevOps tool) is calculated by considering various factors such as Stars, Forks, Watchers, Subscribers, and Issues. Each of these metrics has a weighted contribution to the final score, giving a more comprehensive view of its standing in the developer community.

- **Stars (40%)**: The number of stars a project has on GitHub, indicating its popularity.
- **Forks (25%)**: The number of forks, which represents how often the tool or technology is being used as a base for other projects.
- **Watchers (20%)**: The number of watchers, reflecting interest in the repository for updates.
- **Subscribers (10%)**: The number of users subscribed to the repository for notifications on new changes.
- **Issues (5%)**: The number of open issues, with a higher number of issues affecting the overall score.

The score is calculated using a weighted average of these metrics. Each metric is multiplied by its respective weight, and the total score is normalized to fall between 0 and 1.

Example formula:

```
Score = (Stars * 0.4) + (Forks * 0.25) + (Watchers * 0.2) + (Subscribers * 0.1) + (Issues * 0.05)
```
